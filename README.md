# enzanki_ars's Stream Graphics (v4)

_v4.0.0_

## Known issues

- If the server restarts:
    - The reset is not reflected, which could cause a discrepancy between the admin panel and the on screen graphics.
    - The last graphic configuration is not saved.  
    - If the client disconnects, any changes may not be reflected.
    
## Future plans

- Add a "Update all" button.
- Update display on connect/disconnects.
